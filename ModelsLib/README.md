## Ehh?

I decided to rip out the existing models that were written in C# and replace them with the exact same models. The only difference is that these models are written in F#.

## Why F#?

1. .NET
   1. I didn't have to move forward and learn how everything worked
2. Curiosity
   1. Never messed with F#
   2. Messed with it's functional cousins (i.e. Kotlin, Rust, etc.)
